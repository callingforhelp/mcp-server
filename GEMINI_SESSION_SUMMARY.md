# Gemini Session Summary - MCP Server Development

**Date:** June 27, 2025

**Project Goal:** Develop an MCP server for persistent memory using Qdrant (vector database) and Cohere (embeddings), exposing functions to a Vercel frontend, and embedding a conversational model.

---

## Work Completed in this Session:

1.  **API Refactoring:**
    *   Renamed `/pages/api/promotions` directory to `/pages/api/memory` for a more generic memory management system.
    *   Updated all internal import paths within the moved files (`query.ts`, `search.ts`, `store.ts`).
    *   Removed redundant `/pages/api/search-promotions.ts` endpoint.

2.  **Embedding Integration (Cohere):**
    *   Installed `cohere-ai` SDK and uninstalled `openai` SDK.
    *   Updated `.env.local` and `.env.local.example` to use `COHERE_API_KEY` instead of `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
    *   Modified `/pages/api/memory/store.ts` and `/pages/api/memory/search.ts` to:
        *   Import `CohereClient` correctly.
        *   Use Cohere's `embed` API to generate 384-dimensional vectors (corrected from initial 1024-dim assumption).
        *   Automatically create Qdrant collections if they don't exist, with the correct vector dimensions (384, Cosine distance).

3.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   Created a basic frontend in `/pages/index.tsx` with forms for storing and searching memories.

4.  **Environment Variable Management:**
    *   Ensured `NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERNAL_API_KEY` is used for client-side authorization and updated the backend validation accordingly.
    *   Provided instructions and assisted with setting up `.env.local` and Vercel environment variables via CLI.

5.  **Troubleshooting & Debugging:**
    *   Resolved `npm` permission issues (required user intervention with `sudo chown`).
    *   Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'CohereClient')` by correcting Cohere import.
    *   Addressed "Unauthorized" error by aligning `INTERNAL_API_KEY` usage between frontend and backend.
    *   Resolved "Vector dimension error" by setting correct Qdrant collection size (384).
    *   Identified current issue: Vercel deployment is returning 404 for API routes, suggesting environment variable configuration or deployment issues on Vercel.

6.  **Version Control:**
    *   Staged and committed all relevant changes to the Git repository.

## Current Status & Next Steps:

*   **Local Development:** The application is fully functional locally (store and search work via `curl` and frontend).
*   **Vercel Deployment Issue:** The Vercel deployment (`mcp-server-blush.vercel.app`) is currently returning 404 for API routes, indicating a problem with how Vercel is building or serving the API.

**Action Required from User:**

1.  **Verify Vercel Environment Variables:**
    *   Log in to your Vercel Dashboard.
    *   Go to your `mcp-server` project -> "Settings" -> "Environment Variables".
    *   **Crucially, confirm that `QDRANT_URL`, `QDRANT_API_KEY`, `COHERE_API_KEY`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_INTERNAL_API_KEY` are all present and correctly configured for the "Production" environment.** (Sometimes they might be set for "Development" or "Preview" only).

2.  **Trigger a New Deployment on Vercel:**
    *   After verifying/correcting the environment variables, go to the "Deployments" tab in your Vercel project and click the "Redeploy" button on your latest deployment. This will force Vercel to rebuild with the correct environment variables.

**Action for Agent (Next Session):**

*   Once the user confirms the Vercel environment variables are set and a new deployment is triggered, the agent will re-test the Vercel deployment using `curl` commands to verify API functionality.
*   If the Vercel deployment is successful, the agent will then provide instructions for using the frontend on the deployed Vercel app.
*   Further steps will include exploring conversational model integration and other features as per the initial plan.
